1999	Night was a mere threat on the quivering lip of the sky and the golden tongue of the sun still licked the recesses of the bridle path, when suddenly, an unnatural shriek emanated from the dark throat of the forest, causing stiff fingers of fear to march firmly down the spine of the motionless maiden.

1999	George stared intently across the table which supported the golden-brown fresh-baked cornbread with butter and sizzling cholesterol-laden bacon which could finish blocking his previously-hardened arteries at any time, into Margerie's clear-blue eyes and realized that she knew what he knew, and she knew that he knew what she knew, and he must practice carpe diem before angina seized the day.

1999	The incessant pulse of the “12:00, 12:00, 12:00, 12:00” on Nick Popadopoulus's (of the Athens, Tennessee, Popadopouluses) VCR reminded him of his very existence and the inscrutability of plurals such as hippopotami, thesauri, and croci, causing him to exclaim, “We are Popadopouli!”	N/A	Cynde Fetherston	Victoria, BC, Canada	Dishonorable Mention
1999	It wasn't the best of times; it wasn't the worst of times; it was the times you'd get if you arranged all possible times (including even fictional times in which the nights were usually dark and stormy) in order from worst to best on the real number line from 0.0 inclusive to 1.0 exclusive and then used a really good uniform random-number generator to pick a value in that range thus choosing the corresponding times—that's the times it was.

1999	She wallowed in splendor, her wondrous white-wide wholeness frolicking with the foam; as she smiled, a salt-bleached booted bone punctuated like a toothpick the purity of her pearlescent dentis; and as her buxom flukes saluted the sea, she winked her wave-washed eye and blubbered, “Call me, Ishmael.”	N/A	Virginia H. Vick	Abilene, TX	Dishonorable Mention
1999	Miss Texas, Mary Sue Carol Langley, fluffed her bouffant blond hair and crammed her ample bosoms into the two-sizes-too-small bikini top … yet she couldn't shake the feeling that she had missed something when the judge from Arkansas asked her surreptitiously whether she could play on the harmonica, only to learn later to her chagrin that what he had actually asked was whether she would play around … like Monica.

1998	The corpse exuded the irresistible aroma of a piquant, ancho chili glaze enticingly enhanced with a hint of fresh cilantro as it lay before him, coyly garnished by a garland of variegated radicchio and caramelized onions, and impishly drizzled with glistening rivulets of vintage balsamic vinegar and roasted garlic oil; yes, as he surveyed the body of the slain food critic slumped on the floor of the cozy, but nearly empty, bistro, a quick inventory of his senses told corpulent Inspector Moreau that this was, in all likelihood, an inside job.	N/A	Bob Perry	Milton, MA	Winner
1998	The international team of astronauts each had a salutary comment as they paused before entering the troubled Mir spacestation: The German, upon seeing the Russian tethered in his capsule, said, "Bei Mir bist du chained"; the American, who had recently reviewed his collection of Disney cartoons, spoke, "Mir, mir off the wall, who will fix it, proud and tall"; but the Israeli astronaut just shook his head and, as he entered, could be heard muttering, "Oy vey is Mir!"

1998	It was a majestic weapon, a masterpiece of form and function, hand-crafted by master gunsmiths, accurate to a hundred yards, its bright silver body and long barrel glistening in the sunlight, the hand-carved ivory inlay warm against the palm, and mom got a good dollar for it after my brother was shot in the back.	Western	Terry Mayer	Oshawa, Ontario	Winner
1998	My heart skipped a beat as the bearded walrus gently nudged me in the small of my back with one smooth, curved tusk, expelling a warm breath of air into my upturned face, its smell of peanuts reminding me of that precious night on Coney Island; the night when I became a woman . . . a woman and a convict.

1998	Her toes tingled when she saw him—mostly the two outer toes, the little ones, whose nails had been ripped off by a lawnmower when she was three—and although it might have been the medicated fungal spray she used for her athlete's foot that caused the sensuous shiver in her digits, she thought it was probably him.	Romance	Brian Kinlan	New Haven, CT	Runner-Up
1998	Rita and Michael's passionate lovemaking was brought to an abrupt end by an unfortunate emission of gas—which prompted Rita to wonder, with more than a little irritation, why playing around with that stupid mask was such a turn-on for her dentist fiancé.	Romance	Helaine R. Freeman	Little Rock, AR	Dishonorable Mention
1998	While the technician finished his work, Elmodine Jaatrix reflected upon how badly the evening was going: the ionizer on her Acme 2100 E-Z Klean dishwasher had burnt out, the window-bot had developed an attitude, and the Instafashion clothing dispenser would only produce athletic supporters and Calvin Klein IX synthawool peasant blouses, and as she stared at the gibbous moon slowly rising in front of her, she pondered morosely, "If they can build cities in the rings of Saturn, why can't they make pants for repairmen that don't droop?"

1998	Like an armadillo making love to a toaster, "The Emperor" shook violently upon its launching pad before, after one last frenzied assault, rising from a thick cloud of smoke and sailing into the atmosphere that wrapped the planet like a thick Amish quilt hand-stitched by loving hands while the menfolk labored in the hay fields.

1998	Sir Lyonnel Ondermappe (so famous for his discoveries of lost civilizations that when people cited him they had only to say, "Look, it's Ondermappe!") paddled silently up the frog-clogged tributary of the Amazon when he spied first one, then a dozen old umbrellas stuck like warnings on the bank next to picnic baskets ritually painted with isobars and, as a frightened frog nearly croaked tripping a button on one umbrella opening it into a blossom of water-repellent fabric, he knew that he had found, not the 'People of the Mist', nor the 'People of the Rainforest', but the mythical 'People of the Partly Cloudy With a Forty Percent Chance of Rain-forest'.

1998	Having committed to memory the route maps leading from Alaska to L.A. and determined to avenge the more than 300 years of ridicule his people had suffered for the popularly assumed whimsy of Eskimo naming conventions, Robson Pollowow ("He who moves mountains") glanced one last time into his hastily rigged rear-view mirror before releasing the hand brake on the Paw Whal Dee Glacier.

1998	The criminal justice system is composed of two separate but equally important elements: the criminals who commit the crimes, and the victims of these offenders; these are their stories — except for crimes like embezzlement and mail fraud, 'cause they just don't make for exciting reading.	Detective	Dave Lyon	Overland Park, KS	Dishonorable Mention
1998	There are a million torn scarves in the naked city, and this was one of them, lying by the radiant body of Cloreta Plakstreak, two-bit movie starlet whose body, ruptured by multiple nail-gun wounds, was soft as Detective Clayborn ran his sweaty hand up and down it until the Chief came, and he had to stop.	Detective	Felix Gottdiener	East Amherst, NY	Dishonorable Mention
1998	If Jenkins had taken the 6:15 train home from the Butlers' Convention as he claimed, then he could not have murdered Lord Albert at 6:41; however, if Jenkins had gotten off the train at Ashford-on-the-Heath, taken a speedboat down the river, and caught a hang glider off Dead Man's Bluff, then he could have strangled Lord Albert with the garter belt and escaped on his skateboard, showing up after the train arrived at 7:12, the inspector surmised.	Detective	Laura Loomis	Alameda, CA	Dishonorable Mention
1998	It was a stark and balmy night, the sultry breeze occasionally interrupted by the hot wind known as the Santa Ana sweeping across the desert floor (for it is in Palm Springs that our story is set), whipping violently past the cholla, the ocotillo, and the Joshua tree, moving inexorably westward where it would push the low-lying smog of the San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys toward the ocean to hang like a brown, toxic, gaseous imitation of The Shroud of Turin above the beach at Santa Monica.

1998	Her eyes were green, lichen green, the kind that grows in fish tanks if you don't clean them for several weeks, because you keep putting it off—until you're not even sure if you have live fish in there, and you don't bother anymore, that shade of lichen green.

1998	After we made love, she clung to me ecstatically, like clean laundry fresh from the dryer when you have forgotten to throw in one of those fabric softener pads that you can pick up at Price Chopper, the supermarket that uses an ax hacking off a part of George Washington's head as a logo, for seventy-nine cents a dozen, when they're on sale.

1998	Bound hand and foot, without an apple in her hand, Lady Elspeth could only struggle fruitlessly as Sarak's evil face loomed over her, his black eyes flashing evilly. "Now," he sneered, "the English memsahib will feel the weight of my wrath!" So saying he inserted the disk into the CD player, and as the strains of "Mountain Greenery," in the mellow tones of The Velvet Fog, rang through the Khyber Pass, Lady Elspeth knew finally that this was the dark Khan's Torme night!

1998	Detective Squires was happy with his work, after 48 hours of intense questioning Moses had spilled the beans, the whole story, everything there was to know about the "Miracles", how he did it, when he did it and who his accomplices were, Detective Squire grabbed his phone restlessly, "Put an APB out on 'The Almighty'" he growled at the helpless patrolman on the other end of the line, as he turned back into the interrogation room and thought 'Any time you turn a prophet, that's gotta be good'.

1998	Bill hadn't laughed this much since that day he executed a quick prank for his co-workers, a precise pratfall that amused him even while he concocted it, making him laugh so hard that tears came to his eyes, a fierce laugh that he had to let loose yet again, just as he had during the thinking of the tight antic.

1998	Yes, Jarvik had torn Colette's heart in two, but only after cracking her heaving, alabaster sternum with the spreader of his infidelity, and piercing the pericardium of her trust with his pernicious falsity, which he then poised like the rusty, serrated Scalpel of Damocles over the ascending branch of the aorta of her desire, threatening to sunder her intercardial septum of hope, like so much myocardial butter.

1998	Across the moon-swept lawn Daphne fled his baleful stare from the Conservatory window, her silken gown flowing behind her but catching on the sumac sprouts and rabbit berry, the rose of Sharon and wintercreeper, the milkwort and forsythia, the furze and genista, the tamarisk and jute, the sisal, sand myrtle and yellowroot until its lacy tatters gloried in the soft wind and she realized she was naked and cold near the hothouse.	N/A	Tom Hefferon	Schenectady, NY	Dishonorable Mention
1998	He was more than an Israeli thief of the streets, more than the first flautist in the Jerusalem Philharmonic Orchestra, more than the illegitimate child of a Spanish nun; Jose had led a checkered life that included wrestling and farm work on the kibbutz, a career that truly made him a Haifa-lootin', flutin'-tootin', son of a nun from Barcelona, tag-team plowboy Joe.	N/A	Phil Arkow	Stratford, NJ	Dishonorable Mention
1998	Cats bury their droppings with all the decorum of a state funeral, and dogs revisit theirs with the fervour of a connoisseur, but cattle hardly seem to commit to the whole process, wandering off with a truly bovine indifference while the last soft plop is still echoing through the pasture, and it was this last which inspired Angela's choice of vocabulary when Kevin opened his mouth and let fall the words, "I love you."	N/A	Penny Downing	Scarborough, Ontario	Dishonorable Mention
1998	As the robber looked away, the pharmacist pulled out a .38 revolver, and shouted "Take this three times a day!", firing three rapid shots into the upper left quadrant of the robber's chest, the bullets flying out of the gun like large, ill-fitting, improperly inserted suppositories.

1998	A shrill scream pierced the black night, and I clutched my Tickle-Me Elmo doll close to my heaving bosom; it was the blood-curdling shriek of the wajorcka lop – a vicious, exotic animal that is the cross of a mallard duck and a cat, that is, if you can keep the cat from eating the duck.

1998	Dr. Charles Monroe wasn't the kind of guy who took it lying down, because many years ago a Special Branch trainee bounced one time too many on his impeccably groomed abdominal muscles and caused seven discs to dislocate, the way a stack of CDs might dislocate if they were tied together by string and then the middle ones were pushed out by a lateral force.

1998	Johnny Baggadonuts knew the game was getting stale; he was pretty sure Jimmy Dareallibadone, the cruelest guy in the "family", knew what he was up to, and whatever Jimmy knew, the Boss was sure to find out—yet Johnny knew he couldn't crumble, because if they dunked him he'd have broken his promise to the beautiful if slightly underage Turkish prostitute Alhava Anna (whom everyone called "Muffin") and who wanted nothing more than to be his wife, to finally be Alhava "Muffin" Anna Baggadonuts: the name positively tripped off his tongue, then accidentally lit a fire in his loins.

1998	Walking back to the hotel in the rain, Ernest Hemingway ducked into the Louvre as the downpour intensified, but the beauty of its masterpieces did not move him, for he was thinking about his almost-finished novel, the one about his stint as an ambulance driver on the Italian/Austrian front, of his wounding and recuperation, about his romance with a British nurse that ended catastrophically, and then, standing before the exquisite statue of Venus de Milo, the title he would give his opus occurred to him.

1998	Something is rotten in Denmark, thought Richard, the third time he peered over his copy of the Globe to witness the Two Gentlemen from Verona as they Leared Shrewishly at the young Desdemona, reminding him of that Dreamy Midsummer's night years ago, when, in a Tempest he had journeyed to that little Hamlet in upstate New York where the lawns were green, the picket fences white, and nobody's windows were Bard.

1998	His mind frapped by their final conversation, Master Chef Ralph tried valiantly to deglaze the pan of his brain, reduce the scalding liquid of his affair with Tiffany Creme-Kaake to approximately one-third its original volume (or, better yet, boil it away entirely), strain and discard the lumpy bits, and whisk the memories into a smooth, velvety hollandaise, but it was no use; his heart had been brutally shrink-wrapped and reduced to a hard rubbery mass by the microwave of her indifference.

1998	She sighed, not just any sigh, but one of those deep, deep sighs that, emanating from the depths of your lower respiratory tract, works its way upward, then explodes out of you, pervading the surrounding area, ubiquitously drawing forth sympathetic sighs from those around you in increasing concentrations, until finally you are surrounded by such an intense miasma of wheezing and gasping that it sounds like the emphysema ward in a geriatric hospital.

1998	Myopic, gawky Herbert took up the martial arts to hone his balance, dexterity, concentration, and coordination; the inner calm promised by serene-yet-deadly Sensei Yawara; and immerse himself in the Asian culture that had so mystified the high-school sophomore ever since his fourth-grade field trip paused briefly in Chinatown, but mostly to be able to hang out with the school bullies and beat up other students.

1998	Astronomer Lyman A. Fraunhofer reflected upon the forbidden lines of poetry as he vainly tried to gauge the magnitude of his wife's infidelity with Roy G.

1997	Prince Oryza's determined, handsome countenance was reflected in the gleaming, polished steel of his sword, Gowayoff, as he hewed valiantly at the armored sides of the dragon, which could only be pierced by gleaming, polished steel and not the regular kind of steel, which doesn't gleam as much, and isn't polished quite as well, but does a pretty good job against your smaller dragons.

1997	No one in Cisco City dared to question Jake Lattimer about the disappearance of neighbor Jones's hogs, not only because Jake was the best sheriff the town had ever seen, but also because his was the only dental parlor in the territory where a man could buy himself a decent set of slightly-used false teeth.

1997	The love of her life, Cordelle Horstmussen, wasn't much to look at (he had sunken, bloodshot eyes that were unevenly spaced, differed in color, and—thank God—drew attention from his elfin ears and doubly cleft chin, and his complexion was sallow and dotted with pimply blackheads, so that it resembled month-old cottage cheese in the throes of a fungal blitzkrieg, and he walked with an uneven, duck-footed, and halting gait, like Charlie Chaplin with a case of bleeding piles), but he made her laugh, and now that she realized why, she planned to dump him like a truckload of chicken entrails.

1997	The crimson crushed-velvet dress—with the contrasting gold piping, dainty hint of lace caressing sleeves' end, and scandalous neckline which plunged dramatically to just above the sterling belt buckle exposing yards of flesh—was tailored to cling seductively to every contour of the wearer's body, and Captain Kirk looked ridiculous in it.

1997	It was, presumably, Dr. Livingstone who emerged into the clearing from the dense rain forest beyond, although it was difficult to tell for certain just WHO it was beneath the layers of leeches clinging to his limbs, the spiders covering the surface of his sun helmet, the bounty of bugs on his body, and the multitude of mites crawling on everything from his Mont Blanc pen to his machete though, as he had recently employed the latter in hacking his way through the jungle while he had long abandoned his diary, the pen was somewhat mitier than the sword.

1997	Howard lay benumbed in the shallow crevice where he had collapsed, encrusted with ice from the freezing rain, exhausted from trudging through snow drifts, and frozen by the relentless winds of the freak later-winter storm; and glancing down he noticed the diving watch his wife had given him on their trip to Jamaica, which now seemed a remote memory from another lifetime, but, as he finally succumbed to hypothermia, he was extremely distressed to notice that the watch's crenate bezel had abraded the cuff of his shirt to the point where it would, indubitably, have to be discarded.
