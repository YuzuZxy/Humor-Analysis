2005	Charles stuck his head out the window, not fully realizing that the salt air and warm breeze would have no beneficial effect on a head severed and shrunk in Borneo and sold on a stick to tourists in Bali, and with little thought of the irony of the former missionary's vacant gaze on a nude beach with at least two couples in the missionary position.	Miscellaneous	Mark D. Harmon	Knoxville, TN	Dishonorable Mention
2005	Anyone with a less refined air of unabashed insouciance would not have been able to so easily slip through the security cordon, charm their way past the armed guards, breeze through the marbled reception area and blithely enter the inner sanctum of the UN Security Council and there successfully negotiate an end to all conflict in the Middle East, but that was the sort of man Nigel Simpkins was.

2005	She was standing weepily at her father's grave in the old family cemetery, where the ancient headstones tipped and tumbled like a flock of spring lambs, when she raised her weary eyes to see a shirtless man, his mighty thighs clutching the loins of a raging steed whose breath came hot as a desert wind, and made a mental note to get her hairdryer repaired.	Miscellaneous	Nancy Lee	Chapel Hill, NC	Dishonorable Mention
2005	The wheel of love had left its treadmarks in his chest once too often, like a knobby mud tire on a monster truck, or like a really big ponce wheel, the kind that tailors use to punch little holes in patterns and that would leave lots of nasty little welts if you were to run it up and down your arm.	Miscellaneous	Peter Loughlin	Santa Rosa, CA	Dishonorable Mention
2005	She was independent and impetuous and winning her heart would be like capturing lightning in a bottle, not the plastic kind that is prevalent everywhere today but the glass kind that I used to buy crème soda in at the service station, when they were actually SERVICE STATIONS, two blocks from my house back in the 50's and early 60's and I would return them for two cents deposit which was a quick source of income back then because my allowance was only ten cents a week.

2005	In considering the wisdom of entering upon an affair of the heart with the redoubtable Miss Ffiona Sensuosa, MacFadden Perfidy weighed the undeniable erotic advantages of such a confluence of physiologically coinciding characteristics against the demonstrably unfortunate fact of her exhibiting pronounced advantages over him in terms of wealth, intelligence and personality, and concluded that their union could possibly be inadvisable.	Miscellaneous	Stuart K. Allison	Driffield, East Riding of Yorkshire, England	Dishonorable Mention
2004	She resolved to end the love affair with Ramon tonight . . . summarily, like Martha Stewart ripping the sand vein out of a shrimp's tail . . . though the term "love affair" now struck her as a ridiculous euphemism . . . not unlike "sand vein," which is after all an intestine, not a vein . . . and that tarry substance inside certainly isn't sand . . . and that brought her back to Ramon.	N/A	Dave Zobel	Manhattan Beach, CA	Winner
2004	The notion that they would no longer be a couple dashed Helen's hopes and scrambled her thoughts not unlike the time her sleeve caught the edge of the open egg carton and the contents hit the floor like fragile things hitting cold tiles, more pitiable because they were the expensive organic brown eggs from free-range chickens, and one of them clearly had double yolks entwined in one sac just the way Helen and Richard used to be.	N/A	Pamela Patchet Hamilton	Beaconsfield, Quebec, Canada	Runner Up
2004	She sipped her latte gracefully, unaware of the milk foam droplets building on her mustache, which was not the peachy-fine baby fuzz that Nordic girls might have, but a really dense, dark, hirsute lip-lining row of fur common to southern Mediterranean ladies nearing menopause, and winked at the obviously charmed Spaniard at the next table.

2004	Twas morning--the sun rose under the brightest auspices, and the thin, vaporous clouds that flitted in the heavens, continued gradually to flee away before the gentle morning breeze, that seemed wont to greet their golden visages with the soft rustle of its dewy wings--until not a hand's breadth of them were seen remaining to mar the spotless beauty of the ethereal blue.

2004	Lord Tarlington gazed upon the crazed Egyptian hieroglyphics on the walls of the ancient tomb of the petrified pharaoh, he vowed there would be no curse on him like on that other Lord, unless you count his marriage to Lady Tarlington who, when the lost treasure was found, will be dumped faster than that basket in the bulrushes.	Adventure	Melissa Rhodes	Cherry Valley, CA	Runner Up
2004	Jack planted the magic beans and in one night a giant beanstalk grew all the way from the earth up to the clouds--which sounds like a lie, but it can be done with genetic engineering, and although a few people are against eating gene-engineered foods like those beans it's a high-paying career to think about for when you grow up.	Children's Literature	Frances Grimble	San Francisco, CA	Winner
2004	When Cinderella saw that the Prince had sent the Duke to find the woman of his dreams, like some rich schoolboy who pays the smartest kid in the class to do his homework, or worse, like someone who has been on welfare so long that he has trouble doing any kind of work, she suddenly realized the spoiled nature of the King's son and stealthily slid the slipper back into her pocket.

I'm late."	Children's Literature	Cory Gano	Camas, WA	Dishonorable Mention
2004	It was a stark and dormy night--the kind of Friday night in the dorm where wistful women/girls without dates ovulated pointlessly and dreamed of steamy sex with bad boy/men in the backseat of a Corvette--like the one on Route 66, only a different color, though the color was hard to determine because the TV show was in black and white--if only Corvettes had back seats.	Dark and Stormy Night	David Kay	Lake Charles, LA	Winner
2004	It was a dark and stormy night--actually not all that dark, but more dusky or maybe cloudy, and to say "stormy" may be overstating things a bit, although the sidewalks were still wettish and smelled of ozone, and, truth be told, characterizing the time as night is a stretch as it was more in the late, late afternoon because I think Oprah was still on.	Dark and Stormy Night	Gregory Snider, MD	Lexington, KY	Runner Up
2004	It was another dork and Stormy Knight--after snapping the last of his palm dampened dollar bills into the frazzled elastic of her G string--sent him packing precisely three-eighths of a mile down Highway 20 to the spot where she'd promised him a glorious glimpse of self-awareness, and where he would discover a slight depression in the asphalt and find himself quizzically contemplating the adjacent Department of Transportation sign that read simply: "Dip in Road."

2004	Detective Micky Blarke arrived on the scene at 2:14 am, and gave his cigarette such a severe pull that rookie Paul Simmons swore the insides of the detective's cheeks touched, but the judge indicated that that amount of detail was not necessary in his testimony, and instructed the jury to disregard that statement.

2004	Gringran Roojner had only gone to see the Great Warlock of Loowith to get his horoscope and he couldn't believe he'd been sent on a quest for the legendary Scromer of Nothleen to ask him for the answer to the Riddle of Shimmererer so that he could give it to the Guardians of Vooroniank, thereby gaining access to the Cave of Zothlianath where he would find the seldom seen Cowering of Groojanc, whose spittle was an absolute necessity in the making of the Warlock's famous pound cake, the kind with raisins.

2004	He heard a bang, well not really a bang but more of a crash with metallic overtones of platinum-encrusted steel alloys, hammering against unyielding iron and iridium plates; or maybe it was the clash of huge nickel-zinc rods hitting molybdenum fused sheets of tantalum, then he felt a stab of pain and heard another bang, and wished, instead of using his extensive metallurgy skills to try and analyze the sound, he would have run like hell when he first saw the gun pointed at him.

2004	Students often said that Dr. Storm's lectures were duller than dishwater, not the dishwater after a holiday meal with brightly colored vegetable bits and shimmering glosses of vinaigrette, but the dishwater after a Wednesday night macaroni dinner, when the cheese has disintegrated into slime and the macaroni has become mush clogging the drain.	Purple Prose	Alaine Sepulveda	Las Cruces, NM	Dishonorable Mention
2004	Stealth was the watchword as two shadowy figures trudged in moonlit silence along the narrow pathway superimposed upon a boulder-littered landscape, unwittingly approaching a slimy procession of slugs vulnerably creeping at a snail's pace, but heroically trying (quite unproductively, one does not wonder) to scamper away from the crushing footfalls of the insentient travelers who stumbled blindly toward a destination which would not bid them welcome.

2004	Looking up from his plate of escargots, Sean gazed across the table at Sharon and sadly realized that her bubbly personality now reminded him of the bubbles you get when you put salt on a slug and it squirms around and foams all over the place, and her moist lips were also like the slime on a slug but before you salted it, though after all these years Sharon still smelled better than slugs, but that could have been the garlic butter on her escargots.

2004	The huge intergalactic cruiser -- type 4843-56B, class PVT/X -- which was the color of an unripe blood-grapefruit (a sort of orangey-green like the skin, not the deep fuchsia of the flesh in the middle) edged its way carefully between the navigation buoys, which flashed intermittently like a pair of warning lights outside of a fire house, accept they were more of a pinky-red rather than a dirty yellow.

2004	After putting down her hometown newspaper from a small community in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (which makes one wonder why it is the Upper Peninsula of Michigan since no part of their land touches the lower portion of the state and in actuality they are connected to Wisconsin which makes you think they should be the Upper Peninsula of Wisconsin but that is to be discussed another day), Linda needed to find a sympathy card to send to the family of someone she saw in the obituaries.

2004	I woke up in Shirley's father's dog's house -- or at least most of me did, because the house was ranch style as near as I could figure it and Shirley's father's dog Tracey was one of those little terrier types with the sardonic overbite and the haunted eyes of a Flamenco dancer.

2003	They had but one last remaining night together, so they embraced each other as tightly as that two-flavor entwined string cheese that is orange and yellowish-white, the orange probably being a bland Cheddar and the white . . . Mozzarella, although it could possibly be Provolone or just plain American, as it really doesn't taste distinctly dissimilar from the orange, yet they would have you believe it does by coloring it differently.

2003	The flock of geese flew overhead in a "V" formation - not in an old-fashioned-looking Times New Roman kind of a "V", branched out slightly at the two opposite arms at the top of the "V", nor in a more modern-looking, straight and crisp, linear Arial sort of "V" (although since they were flying, Arial might have been appropriate), but in a slightly asymmetric, tilting off-to-one-side sort of italicized Courier New-like "V" - and LaFonte knew that he was just the type of man to know the difference.

2003	His knowing brown eyes held her gaze for a seeming eternity, his powerful arms clasped her slim body in an irresistible embrace, and from his broad, hairy chest a primal smell of "male" tantalized her nostrils; "Looks like another long night in the ape house" thought veterinarian Abigail Brown as she gingerly reached for the constipated gorilla's suppository.	All Creatures Great and Small	Paul Jeffery	Oxford, England	Winner
2003	It wasn't the desolate remoteness of the campsite that bothered him, or even the terrifying roar of the rapids beating themselves against solid granite below, so much as the eerie sound of pigs squealing in the distance and the fact that, in this light, cousin Billy looked disturbingly like Ned Beatty.

2003	On the fourth day of his exploration of the Amazon, Byron climbed out of his inner tube, checked the latest news on his personal digital assistant (hereafter PDA) outfitted with wireless technology, and realized that the gnawing he felt in his stomach was not fear--no, he was not afraid, rather elated--nor was it tension--no, he was actually rather relaxed--so it was in all probability a parasite.

2003	Mac was the crustiest ex-LAPD homicide detective with three ex-wives, two mortgages, a greedy daughter wasting time at college, a gay son playing acid-blues punk in some Sacramento dive, and a liver that had been bitch slapped by cheap vodka so many times it looked like a bag of yellow fat, who ever walked into my floral and gift shop.

2003	Had Dorothy known Duncan was a psychopath who would seduce, then brutally murder her, and that her best friend Dana, a forensic pathologist would investigate her death and also fall in love with him, but be saved just in time by Dwayne, her much maligned colleague, perhaps she wouldn't have bought him that Screwdriver.

Detective	Chris Esco	Miami, FL	Dishonorable Mention
2003	The sobering scene was laid out before Detective Robinson like a centerfold spread in Better Homes and Gardens or Martha Stewart Living, if the splayed bodies could be considered home furnishings such as hand-knotted 100% wool Tibetan area rugs or allergy-free hypodown throw pillows stuffed with European goose down and the blood on the walls had been a carefully spattered burnt vermillion latex paint for a classic aged or contemporary Jackson Pollock-like finish.

2003	Raul strode through the dark night, his way lit by twinkling stars as if the gods at some celestial concert were all flicking their lighters at the same time in appreciation of the drum solo-like beat of his boot heels against the pavement, occasionally accompanied by the steel-brush-on-a-cymbal sound of a splash as he kicked through a puddle, the plip-plop of water dripping from leaves like someone playing staccato on a two-note piano gone flat, and the wind blowing a bluesy tissue-paper-on-comb harmonica through the trees.

2003	Anton was attracted to Angela like a moth to a flame - not just any moth, but one of the giant silk moths of the genus Hyalophora, perhaps Hyalophora euryalus, whose great red-brown wings with white basal and postmedian lines flap almost languorously until one ignites in the flame, fanning the conflagration to ever greater heights until burning down to the hirsute thorax and abdomen, the fat-laden contents of which provide a satisfying sizzle to end the agony.

2003	Brock de-holstered his Maxi-Hurt 3000 phaser and blasted off the Narguwullian trooper's head, the way a teenager pops the head off a zit, except of course on a much larger scale because those Narguwullians are big suckers, and although Brock had personally had some door stoppers in his teenage years, most zits aren't twelve feet high, blue, and liable to rip your arms off if you look at them the wrong way, and are also much less inclined to leave a mess on the flight deck.

2003	The final auction item in the estate was the electric home in the frozen tundra, often referred to as "the top of the world," even though the world doesn't really have a top (or a bottom for that matter), and it was expected that Mrs. Claus, a pleasantly plump lady who smelled of cookie dough, would again have to outbid the jovial fat man's former employees to purchase his assets, that is until the gavel fell and the auctioneer announced solemnly, "The elves have left the building."

2003	Holly had reached the age and level of maturity to comprehend the emotional nuances of Thomas Wolfe's assertion "you can't go home again," but in her case it was even more poignant because there was no home to return to: her parents had separated, sold the house, euthanized Bowser, and disowned Holly for dropping out of high school to marry that 43-year-old manager of Trailer Town in Idaho -- and even their trailer wasn't a place she could call home because it was only a summer sublet.

2001	Alas, Vanessa sighed, "What can one do when one's relationship begins to stale in much the same way as a day-old cinnamon roll which was wrapped in wax paper rather than having been sealed in plastic, and can only be made remotely palatable for a very brief period when reheated for a few seconds in a microwave, after which it becomes even more revolting than it was in the first place?"

2001	As I gazed at my new bride's perfectly round face, with its one eyebrow slightly longer than the other, and listened to the continuous ticking of her grinding teeth as she slept, I grabbed a felt-tip marker, realizing that all she was missing were twelve numbers around the perimeter of her face to remind me this was forever.

2001	My first night with Anastasia was the kind of magical, passionate ride that left me with my pants on the back of the kitchen chair, my underwear on the chandelier, my socks in the toilet, my hair on the door handle, half of my artificial leg somewhere in the pantry, my kidney in a Coleman ice chest on its way to the Moroccan black market, and my car in a Tijuana auto repair shop with new, red, diamond-tuck interior.

2001	From the roundel of her fifth-story pied-à-terre, Clara watched her ex approach, strutting to retrieve a moldy yearbook to aid his recall for the R.M. Nixon High class of '76 silver reunion, oblivious he would be as invisible to them now as then, although his electro-plated medallion and scalp peering through the feathered fringes of his comb-over both bore the startling sheen of passing time, and her heart pounded with the sudden conviction justice was served when disco died and no one told Roger.

2001	Was it only a dream then? she lamented, lying on her side, and were these sweat-soaked sheets merely the product of her lonely erotic subconscious, and the tears began to flow as she turned over onto her other side, abated briefly as she noticed the teeth still in the glass at the bedside, and began again in earnest as she recognized the familiar reverberation of the flushing toilet in the bathroom - yes, Earl had stayed the night!

2001	It's hard to believe that Lucy and I are actually getting married, considering the fact that her multi-millionaire father owns the local NFL franchise, and I'm just a lowly, underpaid member of the grounds crew, relegated to painting the team logo on the field, which is actually a fairly difficult job, what with all the little flairs, curlicues and swooshes I have to deal with, not to mention the texture of the turf itself, relative humidity and all the foot traffic that it gets . . . but I dye grass.

2001	It was a dark and stormy night when Leviathan-sized waves pitched Malcom overboard from the small schooner and he found himself clinging to a cider barrel in the tempest-tossed sea, to be borne thereon to a barren atoll leagues off the main shipping lanes, a sandy dot in the ocean whose only life was a leafy shrub with a pulpy substance inside its stems, which, with the contents of the life-saving barrel, long since gone sour, provided Malcom's sustenance for the next months until a search party discovered him, not emaciated and sere as one would expect but literally full of pith and vinegar.

Dark & Stormy	James Bardsley	Skillman, NJ	Winner
2001	The afternoon was gray and cloudy; the drizzle fell intermittently -- in the distance, across the Potomac, a torrent was stealthily creeping eastward -- amongst a gently wafting breeze amongst the trees lining the Mall (for it is in Washington that our scene lies), misting the windows of the passing cars, and annoying the feral cats that lived in Rock Creek Park who would soon be mad as wet hens as the night became dark and stormy.

2001	The shattering news hit him like a blow to the solar plexus, and his adrenal glands prepared for a massive secretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine in the classic "fight or flight" response as he realized the truth-the mind-deadening months of toil, the endless Little Debbie Snack Cake-fueled late nights, the ingratiating compliments to the CEO's pubescent fourth wife, the obsequious pandering to the snide staff in Human Resources, the feigned interest in the Director of Purchasing's numbingly repetititive wingnut collection, the humiliating groveling to win the miniscule Withers-Grimes account, it had all been for nothing; Spivens, it seemed, would be getting the much-coveted translucent blue pencil sharpener.

2001	Bayard Wingate sat in his Biloxi office, softly repeating the Southern pronunciation of his name, which no one at Yale had gotten right, Northerners being congenitally unable to say his first name correctly because the art of slurring the letter 'y' in a flourish of the soft palate so that it did not demarcate a second syllable but rather slid into an elision, along with the knowledge that the second syllable of his last name was pronounced 'git,' as one would exhort a stray dog to depart, formed part of a deep pool of consciousness alien to those born north of the Mason-Dixon line.

1998	Dr. Charles Monroe wasn't the kind of guy who took it lying down, because many years ago a Special Branch trainee bounced one time too many on his impeccably groomed abdominal muscles and caused seven discs to dislocate, the way a stack of CDs might dislocate if they were tied together by string and then the middle ones were pushed out by a lateral force.

1998	Johnny Baggadonuts knew the game was getting stale; he was pretty sure Jimmy Dareallibadone, the cruelest guy in the "family", knew what he was up to, and whatever Jimmy knew, the Boss was sure to find out—yet Johnny knew he couldn't crumble, because if they dunked him he'd have broken his promise to the beautiful if slightly underage Turkish prostitute Alhava Anna (whom everyone called "Muffin") and who wanted nothing more than to be his wife, to finally be Alhava "Muffin" Anna Baggadonuts: the name positively tripped off his tongue, then accidentally lit a fire in his loins.

1998	Walking back to the hotel in the rain, Ernest Hemingway ducked into the Louvre as the downpour intensified, but the beauty of its masterpieces did not move him, for he was thinking about his almost-finished novel, the one about his stint as an ambulance driver on the Italian/Austrian front, of his wounding and recuperation, about his romance with a British nurse that ended catastrophically, and then, standing before the exquisite statue of Venus de Milo, the title he would give his opus occurred to him.

1998	Something is rotten in Denmark, thought Richard, the third time he peered over his copy of the Globe to witness the Two Gentlemen from Verona as they Leared Shrewishly at the young Desdemona, reminding him of that Dreamy Midsummer's night years ago, when, in a Tempest he had journeyed to that little Hamlet in upstate New York where the lawns were green, the picket fences white, and nobody's windows were Bard.

1998	She sighed, not just any sigh, but one of those deep, deep sighs that, emanating from the depths of your lower respiratory tract, works its way upward, then explodes out of you, pervading the surrounding area, ubiquitously drawing forth sympathetic sighs from those around you in increasing concentrations, until finally you are surrounded by such an intense miasma of wheezing and gasping that it sounds like the emphysema ward in a geriatric hospital.

1998	Back at the badger ranch, Betsy had gone completely nuts; flinging down the gauntlet of desperation (made from a very high-quality badger hide), she vowed she would wait no longer and in a twinkling her bags were packed, her house sold, and, armed with her cat, her cajones and her capital gains, she left the provincial desolation of Minot and tremblingly catapulted her life into the hot lights and fleshpots of Fargo, City on the Edge.

1998	Myopic, gawky Herbert took up the martial arts to hone his balance, dexterity, concentration, and coordination; the inner calm promised by serene-yet-deadly Sensei Yawara; and immerse himself in the Asian culture that had so mystified the high-school sophomore ever since his fourth-grade field trip paused briefly in Chinatown, but mostly to be able to hang out with the school bullies and beat up other students.

1998	Have a nice day, called Nadine to her engineer husband, who wondered if she meant the remaining hours of daylight, a solar day (measured with respect to the Sun) or a sidereal day (measured with respect to the celestial sphere), "I know I will," continued Nadine sotto voce, whose day (however defined) would be nice because of Raoul, the tennis pro at the country club.

Fantasy	J. N. Pechota	Dulzura, CA	Winner
1997	No one in Cisco City dared to question Jake Lattimer about the disappearance of neighbor Jones's hogs, not only because Jake was the best sheriff the town had ever seen, but also because his was the only dental parlor in the territory where a man could buy himself a decent set of slightly-used false teeth.

1997	The love of her life, Cordelle Horstmussen, wasn't much to look at (he had sunken, bloodshot eyes that were unevenly spaced, differed in color, and—thank God—drew attention from his elfin ears and doubly cleft chin, and his complexion was sallow and dotted with pimply blackheads, so that it resembled month-old cottage cheese in the throes of a fungal blitzkrieg, and he walked with an uneven, duck-footed, and halting gait, like Charlie Chaplin with a case of bleeding piles), but he made her laugh, and now that she realized why, she planned to dump him like a truckload of chicken entrails.

1997	Ah swearta God! moaned Melody-Sue from the depths of her misery, staring glumly past that quivering, pulsating bulb of a belly, while her overstretched womb delivered an apparently endless stream of salamanderkins (sixty-seven? eighty-five? she had lost count) onto the growing heap of squirming sluglets between her outstretched knees, "if evah agayn let a Venusian Toad-Boy sweet-talk me inta lettin' him fraisshen mah drink with sqrzzl-root juice, New Year's party or no, ah oughta have mah haid examined!"

1997	It was, presumably, Dr. Livingstone who emerged into the clearing from the dense rain forest beyond, although it was difficult to tell for certain just WHO it was beneath the layers of leeches clinging to his limbs, the spiders covering the surface of his sun helmet, the bounty of bugs on his body, and the multitude of mites crawling on everything from his Mont Blanc pen to his machete though, as he had recently employed the latter in hacking his way through the jungle while he had long abandoned his diary, the pen was somewhat mitier than the sword.

1997	Howard lay benumbed in the shallow crevice where he had collapsed, encrusted with ice from the freezing rain, exhausted from trudging through snow drifts, and frozen by the relentless winds of the freak later-winter storm; and glancing down he noticed the diving watch his wife had given him on their trip to Jamaica, which now seemed a remote memory from another lifetime, but, as he finally succumbed to hypothermia, he was extremely distressed to notice that the watch's crenate bezel had abraded the cuff of his shirt to the point where it would, indubitably, have to be discarded.

1997	With the last rays of sunshine silhouetting her slim form, and the still-smoking pistol clutched in her trembling right hand, Cora knelt beside the body at her feet, only to be brought up short by the sudden awareness of that unmistakable creeping-insect-like feeling of a run ripping up the back of her left stocking.

1997	As Lt. James "Jocko" Flannery methodically surveyed the freshly sketched chalk outline on the oily pavement with his steel-blue eyes, his mind wandered to that night's poker game—jeez, he had forgotten to pick up the Macanudos—because that's what happens when you fight your way up from street cop to Chief of Homicide in the City with Big Shoulders: you stop being angry; you've seen too many cheap hits, too many gutless punks, and too many brazen calling cards like the one over there—a wad of peppermint chewing gum clinging to the gutter that told him everything he needed to know—that little blond brat from around the corner had maliciously scribbled this pink hopscotch thing on his newly sealed driveway.

1997	Bjorn Petersen, the big Swede, swaggered into the private detective's office, shouting and swinging his fists, obviously bruising for a fight, so Sam Shovel stood up, neatly fooled him with a quick right feint while flooring him with a left hook, then thought to himself, "There's a Bjorn suckered every minute!"

1997	It was the last of times, it was the first of times, it was the age of intelligence, it was the age of the intellectually challenged, it was the epoch of reality, it was the epoch of insanity, it was the season of Salt, it was the season of Pepper, it was the spring of health, it was the winter of the flu, it was a period when a bunch of really opposite things were being compared.

1997	Day broke like an enormous egg cracking over the rim of the great, jagged-edged bowl of the Grand Canyon, its bright yellow yolk of sunshine pouring runnily into every crag and crevice, suffusing the early morning air with the same ocherous brilliance as it had for millennia while the mighty Colorado River cuts its way to the stratum of the present valley floor.

1997	Holy mackerel, we cod advertise Eddie Fisher to reel in suckers, then if we're accused of bait-and-switch tactics and face a herring our squid pro quo lawyer could clam the embarracudasing incident was a fluke, nothing to carp about—though we'd be eel-advised to take a wade-and-sea attitude or angle for a mistrout, bubbled Salmon Rushdie, sardine 'cause he shad have knocked off the crappy puns a minnow earlier, giving scallop's honor he didn't do it on porpoise and to enshark us it won't harpoon again.

1997	Not long ago I came into possession of a certain Malaysian lizard and by sheer good luck it accidentally walked through some wet paint and then across a sheet of paper and made such a mess that an art expert said it was "Neo-reptilian," so now I plan to move to Spain where it will be a cinch to con the artsy types with this fly-eating Van Gogh who is being called (I'm not making this up) "El Gecko."

1997	Thinking that she was plain vanilla and this would be a piece of cake, I turned on the heat while I buttered her up with sugary words and floury phrases, but I soon realized that it was a half-baked idea when her nuts-to-you attitude told me that even though she turned out to be quite a dish, we didn't have all the ingredients necessary to make this relationship anything more than pie in the sky.

1997	Try as he might, the coroner was unable to find the cause of death, so he called in the world-famous Los Angeles psychic Madam DuBois, who determined that Julie Andrews had been killed by a precisely administered dose of lethally bad breath, so the next morning's newspaper headlines trumpeted, "Super California Mystic: Expert Halitosis."	Vile Puns	Ross Borden	Victoria, BC	Dishonorable Mention
1997	It was with no small degree of trepidation that Mapping Sciences teacher Geo. G. Raphy peered pensively at the seventh-graders (who were working feverishly on their in-class assignment of drawing their favorite English isle) and rued his rashly made but fateful decision to allow the two impish Chinese twins to complete the assignment together—for he knew, deep within his soul, the brilliant brothers would seize this opportunity to prove that, at least on some occasions, two Wongs can make a Wight.

1996	The flash of lightning startled her, making her breasts heave, and in that instant of white light she thought of how M____, her young lover from the estate's cheese works, had so marveled at the creamy globes so delicately laced with blue veins that he had called the one Bleu and the other Stilton, and she reflected that she would never hear those sweet words again—at least not in that context, for come tomorrow she would be Lady Vile-Conundrum.

1996	The city at night has a million stories, like the woman who, even now, was weeping over the bloody corpse of her lover lying where she had slashed him from neck to kneecap, or the twelve-year-old kid prostrate on the sidewalk after a drug deal gone wrong, or the babe, desperate to find the stuff that stopped your dress from sticking to your legs after you ironed it and couldn't find a convenience store at this black hour in a city without a name.

1996	From the dilapidated porch, Hoover "Hoo-Boy" Hogwattle squinted at the ducks scattered across the oily surface of the pond like the blackheads across Cousin Joe-Bob's nose, and, spitting tobacco juice and scratching incessantly, wished that Maw had remembered to use that new downy-fresh fabric softener on the pink lace bra and panties he was wearing under his grimy overalls.

1996	It was a hot as a jalapeño outside, the smog hung in the air like bits of pepper on three-day-old cottage cheese, and the Condiment Police, after extricating themselves from one pickle after another, were running late in their effort to ketchup with a bad egg named Sal Sodium who was armed to the teeth and who was stalking a gorgeous tomato for the twenty-four carrots on her finger, so they slipped into their flak jackets with relish before moving in on a salt with a deadly weapon.

1996	Nigel lifted his Mont Blanc pen and held it in brief repose as he gazed past the conflagrative crackling in the hearth, through the triple-plate bay window, watching the incandescence of the twinkling stars like the detonation of a million flashbulbs, and the preponderance of frothy snowflakes blanketing the earth as creamily as marshmallow fluff, then, refreshed and inspired, he began to compose his annual Christmas form letter.

1996	Tess was a fallen angel with a heart as big and as golden as all outdoors; a heart as big as all outdoors and all indoors; a heart as big as a solarium, which is a room that is like outdoors but indoors; unlike one of those bump-out kitchen greenhouse windows, which is neither.	Purple Prose	Barbara S. Combs	Seattle, WA	Runner-Up
1996	Because the Indians of the high Andes were believed to have little sense of humor, Professor Juan Lyner was amazed to hear this knee-slapper that apparently had been around for centuries at all the Inca hot spots: "Llama ask you this.

1996	Baron Frankenstein looked up from his sewing, smiled benignly across the laboratory at his similarly-engaged creation and protégé, and called, "Yes, yes! Put on a happy face; tonight will be your first date with the rest of your wife!"	Vile Puns	Anthony Buckland	Vancouver, BC	Runner-Up
1996	Following the unfortunate bucking of his horse when it was startled by the posse's shots, Tex—who now lay in a disheveled heap in the sagebrush—pushed back his sweat-stained Stetson from one deep-set blue eye, spat a stream of tobacco juice at the nearest cactus, and reflected momentarily that the men approaching him with ropes probably weren't just out for a skip, and—if they were—his freshly broken ankle would have to cause him to decline any entreaties to join them.	Western	Becky Mushko	Roanoke, VA	Winner
1996	The disillusionment of the members of the inner-city Boys' Club with their trip to the country began when they discovered that a hoe-down wasn't what they thought it would be.	N/A	Tom W. Glaser	Hollywood, FL	Dishonorable Mention
1996	When the sound of Big Ben chiming the hour of the rosy-fingered dawn struck my straining ears like a fire alarm, I threw the glockenspiel at the haberdasher and ran for the door, never looking back to see if the foul devil's spawn was giving chase through the impenetrably thick—and terribly clammy—fog that clung to me like a sodden woolen suit, slowing my flight to a crawl as interminable as this sentence.	N/A	David N. Fittinghof	Tracy, CA	Dishonorable Mention
1996	As she turned her grimy, tear-streaked face toward the window, quiet sobs still shook the child's frail body, and her voice had the tone of one whose life has been a continuing chronicle of deprivation and disappointed hopes as she said plaintively, "How come we can't stop at the Seven-Eleven and get a slushy? I want a cherry slushy . . ."	N/A	Karen Mulholland	N/A	Dishonorable Mention
